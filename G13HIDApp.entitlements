    <!-- Required for creating virtual HID devices -->
    <key>com.apple.developer.hid.virtual.device</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Note: This entitlement requires:
         1. An Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
         2. App signed with a Developer ID Application certificate
         3. Proper provisioning profile

         Without this entitlement, IOHIDUserDeviceCreate will fail.

         To add this to your Xcode project:
         1. Select your target
         2. Go to Signing & Capabilities
         3. Click + Capability
         4. Add "HID Virtual Device" capability

         For command-line builds with swift build, you need to:
         1. Code sign your binary: codesign -s "Developer ID Application: Your Name" -f --entitlements G13HIDApp.entitlements .build/debug/G13HIDApp
         2. The entitlement must be included in your provisioning profile
